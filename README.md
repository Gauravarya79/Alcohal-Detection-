# üç∑ Alcohol Detection System using Arduino

This project is a **hardware-based alcohol detection system** built using an **Arduino Uno** and an **MQ-3 alcohol sensor**.  
The system detects alcohol vapors in the air and triggers alerts with an **LED** and **buzzer** when the concentration exceeds a threshold.  
It also prints real-time sensor values on the Serial Monitor for monitoring and calibration.

## üîß Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor (analog + digital output)  
- LED (visual indicator)  
- Buzzer (sound alarm)  
- Resistors, jumper wires, breadboard  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Detects alcohol vapors using MQ-3 sensor (both analog and digital values).  
- Triggers **LED + buzzer alarm** when alcohol exceeds threshold.  
- Displays real-time analog and digital sensor values via Serial Monitor.  
- Can detect alcohol even in small concentrations (including sanitizers and perfumes).

## üöÄ How It Works
1. The MQ-3 sensor measures alcohol concentration in the environment.  
2. If the concentration exceeds the threshold ‚Üí **LED & buzzer turn ON**.  
3. Sensor values are printed in the Serial Monitor for monitoring.
